### Overview:
Nebula is a web-based dashboard that visualizes live or simulated space mission data. It provides real-time information on the International Space Station (ISS) location, Mars weather, and asteroid tracking. The dashboard is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing, making it easy for users to access and understand space-related data.

### Technologies Used:
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **APIs**: Open Notify API (for ISS location), Mars Weather API, Asteroid API (provided by NASA)

### Features:
- **ISS Location**: Displays the current location of the ISS on a map, updating in real-time.
- **Mars Weather**: Provides current weather data on Mars, including temperature, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure.
- **Asteroid Tracking**: Displays information about near-Earth asteroids, including their size, speed, and distance from Earth.
